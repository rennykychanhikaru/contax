## Notes & Decisions

- **Schema baseline:** Supabase currently models `organizations` (no `accounts` table); contains an `audit_logs` table for org-scoped actions and no feature flag tables—PRD migrations still required.
- **Auth utilities:** `lib/db/admin.ts` exposes a Supabase service-role client; admin concept today limited to org owner/admin roles, no global super-admin capability.
- **20251228:** Added migration `supabase/migrations/20251228_super_admin_panel_schema.sql` creating `accounts`, `account_user`, feature flag tables, and `admin_audit_log`. `accounts.id` maps to existing `organizations.id` with triggers keeping names in sync; `account_user` mirrors `organization_members` via triggers/backfill.
- **20251228:** Introduced `middleware/super-admin.ts` guard, `/api/admin/check-access`, and initial admin shell under `app/admin/**` with placeholder routes for dashboard, accounts, feature flags, and activity.
- **20251228:** Added `lib/supabase/server.ts` helper and implemented feature flag CRUD APIs (`app/api/admin/feature-flags/**`) writing audit entries; UI now lists and creates flags directly from the admin panel.
- **20251228:** Super admin guard now enforces step-up MFA (`amr` includes WebAuthn/TOTP) and requires the `super-admin-panel` feature flag to be enabled before granting access; admin layout surfaces gating and MFA messaging.
- **20251228:** Added override management endpoints (`app/api/admin/feature-flags/[flagId]/overrides/**`), UI for searching/selecting flags with per-account/user overrides, and a cached `is_feature_enabled` helper (`lib/feature-flags/cache.ts`) used by the guard.
- **20251228:** Implemented account management APIs (`/api/admin/accounts/**`) and UI with search/filter, disable/enable actions requiring reasons, and audit logging; actor IDs display alongside disable timestamps.
- **20251228:** Super admins can now provision accounts via `/api/admin/accounts` with UI support (generate/reset owner one-time password, modal UX, and audit logging for `ACCOUNT_CREATED`).
- **20251228:** Added bulk disable/enable endpoints (`/api/admin/accounts/bulk-disable`, `/api/admin/accounts/bulk-enable`) with guardrails (max 10 per batch, hourly caps) and wired the admin UI with multi-select actions and result summaries.
- **20251229:** Wired Supabase Realtime subscriptions on `admin_audit_log`; `/api/admin/notifications` seeds a toast queue rendered in `components/admin/AdminLayout.tsx`.
- **20251229:** Added `feature_flag_usage_events` logging (RPC + admin routes) with daily summary view and analytics panel on `/admin/feature-flags`.
- **20251229:** Introduced Vitest harness (`vitest.config.ts`, `npm run test -- --run`) with initial coverage for analytics, notifications, and audit export routes.
- **20251229:** Expanded Vitest coverage to accounts CRUD filters and feature-flag mutations with mocked Supabase admin client.
- **20251229:** Added Playwright scaffold (`playwright.config.ts`, `tests/e2e/admin-panel.spec.ts`) gated by `PLAYWRIGHT_RUN_ADMIN_E2E` for future smoke coverage.
- **20251229:** Drafted API documentation (`docs/api/super-admin.yaml` + quick reference Markdown) covering accounts, feature flags, and audit endpoints.
- **20251229:** Added operator-facing user guide (`docs/admin/super-admin-user-guide.md`) and operations runbook (`docs/runbooks/super-admin-operations.md`).
- Document answers to Milestone 1 open questions here as they land: approval flow owners/SLA, audit log retention, Zero Trust owner, break-glass accountability, environment drift visibility.
- Track any scope deviations or follow-up tasks that surface during implementation.
