# Super Admin Panel – Progress Tracker

Living tracker derived from `/docs/PRD-super-admin-panel.md`. Update this doc whenever a milestone or sub-task is completed. Acceptance criteria lives in the PRD; mirror the status here.

- [ ] **Milestone 5 – Account Management**
  - [x] Implement account disable/enable actions with reasons
  - [x] Record admin actions in audit log with metadata
  - [x] Display account status, disabled timestamps, and actor
  - [x] Support user-level overrides (break-glass path)
  - [ ] Add guardrails for bulk operations & rate limits
- [ ] **Milestone 6 – Observability & Tooling**
  - [ ] Build vitest coverage for critical workflows
  - [ ] Add e2e tests for feature flags and account actions
  - [ ] Document API endpoints & admin user guide
  - [ ] Publish operational runbook (alerts, escalation, recovery)
- [ ] **Milestone 7 – Production Readiness**
  - [ ] Integrate structured logging and performance metrics
  - [ ] Configure alerting for suspicious admin activity
  - [ ] Optimize database queries (<100ms target)
  - [ ] Implement staged rollout + rollback procedures
  - [ ] Validate backups / PITR and incident response drill

## Notes & Decisions

- **Schema baseline:** Supabase currently models `organizations` (no `accounts` table); contains an `audit_logs` table for org-scoped actions and no feature flag tables—PRD migrations still required.
- **Auth utilities:** `lib/db/admin.ts` exposes a Supabase service-role client; admin concept today limited to org owner/admin roles, no global super-admin capability.
- **20251228:** Added migration `supabase/migrations/20251228_super_admin_panel_schema.sql` creating `accounts`, `account_user`, feature flag tables, and `admin_audit_log`. `accounts.id` maps to existing `organizations.id` with triggers keeping names in sync; `account_user` mirrors `organization_members` via triggers/backfill.
- **20251228:** Introduced `middleware/super-admin.ts` guard, `/api/admin/check-access`, and initial admin shell under `app/admin/**` with placeholder routes for dashboard, accounts, feature flags, and activity.
- **20251228:** Added `lib/supabase/server.ts` helper and implemented feature flag CRUD APIs (`app/api/admin/feature-flags/**`) writing audit entries; UI now lists and creates flags directly from the admin panel.
- **20251228:** Super admin guard now enforces step-up MFA (`amr` includes WebAuthn/TOTP) and requires the `super-admin-panel` feature flag to be enabled before granting access; admin layout surfaces gating and MFA messaging.
- **20251228:** Added override management endpoints (`app/api/admin/feature-flags/[flagId]/overrides/**`), UI for searching/selecting flags with per-account/user overrides, and a cached `is_feature_enabled` helper (`lib/feature-flags/cache.ts`) used by the guard.
- **20251228:** Implemented account management APIs (`/api/admin/accounts/**`) and UI with search/filter, disable/enable actions requiring reasons, and audit logging; actor IDs display alongside disable timestamps.
- **20251228:** Super admins can now provision accounts via `/api/admin/accounts` with UI support (generate/reset owner one-time password, modal UX, and audit logging for `ACCOUNT_CREATED`).
- Document answers to Milestone 1 open questions here as they land: approval flow owners/SLA, audit log retention, Zero Trust owner, break-glass accountability, environment drift visibility.
- Track any scope deviations or follow-up tasks that surface during implementation.
